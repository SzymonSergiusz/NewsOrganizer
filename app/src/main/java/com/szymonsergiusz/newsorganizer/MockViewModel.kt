//        description = """Wikipedia says that a dead drop is “a method of espionage tradecraft used to pass items or information between two individuals (e.g., a case officer and an agent, or two agents) using a secret location, thus not requiring them to meet directly and thereby maintaining operational security.“
//
//How is it that every web server is a dead drop, then? Think about what a web server does. It takes requests, serves the files, and write a log. It logs every request even if that request is invalid.
//
//Consider it for a moment: Every web server gives you the privilege of writing something in its log file. Would it be possible to use this privilege to any advantage? Perhaps.
//
//The proof of concept is simple. We’re taking a text file getting its md5sum and then gzipping it, uuencoding it, and then writing it to a web servers log file. On the destination server, we extract the uuencoded gzipped file, gunzip it, and check to see if the md5sum matches. It’s done in BASH just because it’s what I’m used to using. But if it can be done in BASH then it can by done in pretty much any “real” language. Let’s have a look!""")
